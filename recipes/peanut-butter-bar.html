    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350° F. Grease a 9 x 13 inch baking pan and set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter in the 9×13 baking pan. Bake for about 28-32 minutes or until just set. But DO NOT overbake. They will firm up as the cool. Let cool before cutting into bars.</li>
        <li>Store tightly covered on the counter for a day or two or freeze for up to a few weeks.</li>
    </ol>
