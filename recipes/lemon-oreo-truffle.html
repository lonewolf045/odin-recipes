    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div>
        <i>Cream cheese and Oreos have a magical relationship that makes them so creamy people might think you slaved over the stove with a candy thermometer.</i> <br>
        You’ll need just three ingredients to make these Lemon Oreo Truffles and they are super quick to make. They’re creamy inside with a lovely lemony sweetness.
        <br>
        The lemon is just a perfect fit for the creamy Oreo filling. I’m not sure what I’m going to do if they’re ever discontinued!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package Lemon Oreos</li>
        <li>8 oz cream cheese softened</li>
        <li>3 cups white chocolate melting chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pulse Oreos, filling and cookie portions, in a food processor until finely ground. Combine the Oreo crumbs and softened cream cheese in a mixing bowl, and beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Roll mixture into balls using a generous tablespoon per ball. Place the balls in the freezer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place white chocolate in a deep bowl. Microwave for 10 seconds at a time until smooth, stirring after each time. Dip the partially frozen balls into white chocolate and place on parchment paper to harden.</li>
        <li>If desired, tint some white chocolate yellow with food coloring and drizzle over the chocolate-covered truffles. Store in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
